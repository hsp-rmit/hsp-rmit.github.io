                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                The project idea that our group has decided to explore is a Cooking Application, according to a
                                Think with Google article “Cooking trends among Millennials: Welcome to the digital kitchen” it is reported
                                that millennials, in this data represented by 25-35 year olds, are cooking more and that 59% of them are reported to
                                cook with a smartphone or tablet nearby. The data also shows that Youtube has become a large resource for learning how
                                to cook with “How to Cook That” being one of the 10 most popular how-to searches on the platform. With this large interest
                                among young adults, we believe that an application which could simplify the approach of finding recipes and is able to guide
                                the user through the cooking process will be one which could cater to this growing audience.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Search Features</h3>
                            <p>
                                The current features and ideas we have for such a project is for an application which would store a large number
                                and variety of cooking recipes which can be tagged with a variety of categories and characteristics i.e Vegan, Chinese,
                                Quick, Cheap, ect. Giving the user the ability to browse through recipes when they do not have a particular dish in mind
                                and may lead to some discovery for things the user has never heard of. The search feature will be robust, in addition be
                                searching by the name of the recipe, the user will also be able to search by ingredients, dietary restrictions e.g,
                                allergies, vegetarian etc, amount of expected calories and any of the categories and characteristics. When searching
                                by ingredients the user will be able to tailor the search in multiple ways, they can choose to search for recipes which
                                only contain all of the selected ingredients, only contain some or all of the selected ingredients or search for recipes
                                which contains the selected ingredients and include other ingredients as well. It is set up this way as the planned use
                                case for this feature was for the user to be able to look through the available ingredients they have on hand, i.e whatever
                                is lying around the fridge or pantry, and find a recipe based on that, as such the multiple search parameters will give the
                                user some options such as if they don’t want to or can’t go out and buy more ingredients, just want to use up what they have at hand but are willing to go out and buy whatever extras they need or even if
                                the user just feels like cooking something that has some of those ingredients in them.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Guided Cooking</h3>
                            <p>
                                After the user selects a recipe the application will show the standard recipe display; A short description of the recipe,
                                ingredients, expected time and the method. The recipe should be as short and concise as possible as when looking at a recipe
                                in the middle of cooking the user will want to spend as little time as possible searching for their next step. Should there
                                be enough resources available to the team a guided cooking feature may be added, this feature will seek to make the cooking
                                process easier and will show instructions on screen and a timer if needed, for example it will instruct the to chop up
                                vegetables and when completed it will then instruct the user to cook those vegetables in a pan for the recommended 10
                                minutes, while cooking the vegetables the application will display a timer for 10 minutes and alert the user when the
                                10 minutes has passed, this process will continue until the user cancels out of the feature or the recipe is completed.
                                As it will take a lot of manpower to individually create these guided process for each recipe on the application, we may
                                begin first with only a select amount of the recipes supporting this feature and may implement more if user feedback is
                                positive.
