                                            Having recently completed my degree in Biological Science I am now set to tackle the wild world of IT. Growing up in the semi-rural of Lakes Entrance I 
                                            developed an appreciation for Information Technology as computers were a rare commodity and being able to communicate easily with the outside world was a novel concept. 
                                            I have used some tools such as RPGmaker and Unity to create very small scale project but now I seek to learn the skills necessary to take these projects to the next level. 
                                            I hope to be a valuable asset to the HSP team.

                                            I'm Indonesian, I was born in the United States of America(USA), in Los Angeles garfield hospital. 
                                            But spent most of my life in Jakarta Indonesia. Finished the IB(International Baccalaureate) 
                                            at AIS Australian International School. I don't know if im bilingual or trilingual,
                                            but I know I can speak indonesian, and english quite fluently, I can understand when people speak chinese,
                                            but i can only speak a bit of chinese. Right now I'm learning japanese as a course in my degree,
                                            and of course from all my gaming experiences across multiple platforms, such as FPS, MOBA, MMORPG ,
                                            RPG, I can speak a lot of bad words in a lot of languages. I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy doing,
                                            such as playing a variety of games, netflix/anime and chilling, Singing/playing the piano and listening to music. 
                                            I also love to play sports, such as volleyball, table tennis, tennis, badminton, I used to play golf, 
                                            I'm alright with basketball, and I use to play goalkeeper position in soccer. I hope my chivalrous efforts, 
                                            will be apart of a larger victory with the HSP group.

										</p>
										<p>I was born in Dandenong and raised in the South East suburbs of Melbourne.
											After graduating from Nossal High School in 2013 I took a gap year and did a great 
											deal of travelling, including most of Western Europe and parts of South East Asia. 
											Japan, Portugal, and the Czech Republic were some of my favourites. When I was not 
											travelling I was working various jobs in the construction, events, and transport 
											industries. In 2015 I began studying a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Aerospace 
											Engineering (Honours) but due to a lack of interest I decided to focus my efforts on a 
											military career and instead joined the Army in January, 2017. I graduated from the Royal
											Military College - Duntroon in June, 2018, and was allocated to the Royal Australian 
											Corps of Signals. I am currently posted to the Defence Force School of Signals in Macleod,
											Melbourne, where I am responsible for the command, leadership and mangement of ab-initio 
											Army signallers conducting their Initial Employment Training. When I do find free time, 
											I enjoy spending it riding or tinkering with my motorcycle, four-wheel driving, 
											hiking and mountaineering, SCUBA diving, snowboarding or travelling.</p>

                                        Many of the other group members have tested to be more inclined to valuing group cohesion,
                                        which will greatly increase the groups productivity as we all work better when the group as a
                                        whole works well. Most of the group also tested as introverted, but I do not see this as much of a
                                        problem as we do not have much issue discussing and bringing up our own thoughts on the process of
                                        our work. Our group leans towards a Visual and Tactile learning style which may suggest that we will be able
                                        to grasp concepts easier if we are to have a good representation to interact with and I believe that this will
                                        steer our project towards something which we can produce some sort of prototype to present in the end. Many of
                                        the results indicate that each member of the group prefers to work mostly independently rather than collaboratively,
                                        while this could result in members not being “team players” and not using the other members of the group as valuable
                                        resources, it also means that we are each capable of completing our assigned tasks alone when contacting or meeting up
                                        with the rest of the group is infeasible, although we must take these results into consideration and make an effort to
                                        ensure that we take into account the other members when completing our tasks.
